##  Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle


### Lyric
```
[Intro]

[Verse 1 - Male Vocal]
We're trying to measure, get a clear precise view,
Of where a particle is, what it's gonna do.
Is it here or there? The position we chase,
But the rules of the quantum keep us in our place.

[Verse 2 - Female Vocal]
And what about speed? The momentum we seek,
A different answer, a different technique.
We dial in the focus, try to pin it right down,
But a fuzzy, blurred picture is all that we've found.

[Chorus - Duet]
Oh, you can't have it all, the picture complete,
Position and momentum, a difficult feat.
The more that you know of one in this test,
The more that you lose of the other...
The equation knows best!

[Verse 3 - Male Vocal, faster, rap influence]
Try to shrink down that delta X, make the blur disappear,
The certainty of momentum gets lost, it's clear.
Planck's constant is the limit, the h-bar line,
A fundamental boundary, set by design.

[Verse 4 - Female Vocal, soft and melodic]
Try to narrow the p, the velocity's track,
The knowledge of location is what we then lack.
It's a quantum trade-off, a balance, a deal,
The universe's secret, incredibly real.

[Chorus - Duet]
Oh, you can't have it all, the picture complete,
Position and momentum, a difficult feat.
The more that you know of one in this test,
The more that you lose of the other...
The equation knows best!

[Outro - Both, fading out]
It's a principle of nature, a certainty we can't find.
A fuzzy world of physics, messing with our mind.
Position... momentum... a quantum quest.
The equation knows best!

### Prompt

v2
```
Acoustic ballad with a rap influence. Duet for a female and a male singer. The male singer can deliver the rap verses with a deep, husky male vocal, warm reverb, and gentle vibrato, while the female singer handles the chorus and harmonies with a deep, husky female vocal, warm reverb, and gentle vibrato. Instrumentally, use finger-picked guitar as the primary element. Layer harmonies properly, especially in the chorus. No drums. Include a light grand piano in the background and let a cello jam sometimes during the instrumental breaks and the outro.  Raw, intimate, high fidelity, studio quality, acoustic nilon guitar, recorded in an empty room. Soulful guitar, story telling expressive guitar solo, delightful melancholy, random guitar riffs, 55 bpm.
