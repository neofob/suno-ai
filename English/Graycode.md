*One bit at a time for the fidelity.*

### Lyric Prompt
```
Write a song about the computer science Graycode with the catch pharse "Oh! One bit at a time for the fidelity!". The song is for a duet two singers, one female vocal, one male vocal.
```
### Lyric
```
[Intro]

[Verse 1 - Male Vocal]
We count up in binary, a simple base two,
Zero, one, two, three, that's what we do.
But sometimes the gears get confused on the line,
When more than one bit changes, it messes up the time.

[Verse 2 - Female Vocal]
From seven to eight, that's three ones to a one with three zeros,
The glitches in the system turn the engineers into zeros!
The system gets wobbly, the data's not clean,
A problem with synchronizing, a chaotic scene.

[Chorus - Duet]
But here comes the Gray code, with a brilliant design,
Only one bit changes, every single time.
For the mechanical sensors, the feedback and the ride,
Oh! One bit at a time for the fidelity!

[Verse 3 - Male Vocal, rhythmic]
It's an absolute encoder, on a shaft it spins,
The binary sequence is where the trouble begins.
But with Gray code, the transitions are smooth,
No ambiguity in reading, the problem we soothe.

[Interlude: Melancholic cello solo with light piano]

[Verse 4 - Female Vocal, melodic]
It's a reflect-and-flip, the pattern we see,
A clever way of counting for reliability.
From the Karnaugh maps for logic, to the position of a wheel,
The benefit of Gray code is incredibly real.

[Chorus - Duet]
But here comes the Gray code, with a brilliant design,
Only one bit changes, every single time.
For the mechanical sensors, the feedback and the ride,
Oh! One bit at a time for the fidelity!

[Outro - Both, harmonious]
Just one little change, in the sequence of the code,
Lightening the burden, the engineering load.
A robust solution, a simple design.
Oh! One bit at a time for the fidelity!
For the fidelity!
For the fidelity!
For the fidelity!
[Echoing vocals]

## Prompt

v1
```
Acoustic ballad with a hint of rap influence. Duet for a female and a male singer. The male singer can deliver the rap verses with a deep, husky male vocal, warm reverb, and gentle vibrato, while the female singer handles the chorus and harmonies with a deep, husky female vocal, warm reverb, and gentle vibrato. Instrumentally, use finger-picked guitar as the primary element. Layer harmonies properly, especially in the chorus. No drums. Include a light grand piano in the background and let a cello jam sometimes during the instrumental breaks, intro and the outro.  Raw, intimate, high fidelity, studio quality, acoustic nilon guitar, recorded in an empty room. Soulful guitar, story telling expressive guitar technique, delightful melancholy, 55 bpm. Out of three instruments, only one change at a time.
