# Shadows Between Tongues

### Lyric
```
[Verb 1]
Half a word in my mouth
Half a word in the air
Lost the bridge
Found the silence
Do they even care
The streets don't echo my name
This place ain't mine
This place ain't the same

[Chorus]
Culture shock
A fistful of static
Dreams collide
It's automatic
Shadows between tongues
I can't see the sun
Chasing something
But I’m always undone

[Interlude Melancholic Cello Solo]

[Verb 2]
Held a camera like it could hold my soul
Snapped the light but it left a hole
Tried to dance
Tripped on my feet
This rhythm ain't mine
This life ain't sweet

[Prechorus]
Code on the screen
Pictures in my head
Dreams don’t sleep
They haunt me instead

[Chorus]
Culture shock
A fistful of static
Dreams collide
It's automatic
Shadows between tongues
I can't see the sun
Chasing something
But I’m always undone

[Outro]
Failed start-ups
Broken frames
Lost in the dark
I don’t know my name
Every step forward feels like a fall
A language of walls
No words at all
```


### Prompt
```
At 55 bpm, this melancholy ballad opens with warm acoustic nylon guitar
fingerpicking and subtle cello swells, delicately enhanced by gentle plucks
and soft grand piano. Deep husky male and raspy female voices intertwine in
duet, supported by tasteful rock-blues touches, with warm reverb blending
all elements into an intimate, soulful atmosphere.
