*Cannot have it all!*

### Lyric
```
(Verse 1 - Male Vocal)  
In the world of distributed systems, we're building it out,  
Multiple nodes talking, what's it all about?  
We want our data consistent, a single source of truth,  
Always available, since our tech youth.

(Verse 2 - Female Vocal)  
And what about partitions? The network might fail,  
Nodes get cut off, their messages don't sail.  
We need a plan for disaster, a resilient design,  
A triangle of features, that's incredibly fine.

(Chorus - Duet)  
Oh, the CAP theorem, a rule so true and grand,  
Consistency, availability, partition tolerance at hand.  
The physics of the network, a fundamental wall,  
You can pick just two of the three...  
Cannot have it all!

(Verse 3 - Male Vocal, faster, a bit frustrated)  
We focus on consistency, every read is so neat,  
But a partition hits us, and we suffer defeat.  
Some data's not reachable, the system stalls,  
We lose availability, for consistency's calls.

(Verse 4 - Female Vocal, thoughtful)  
We aim for availability, always up and alive,  
But a network split means our data can't thrive.  
Some nodes are out of sync, the data's not the same,  
We sacrifice consistency in this complex game.

(Chorus - Duet)  
Oh, the CAP theorem, a rule so true and grand,  
Consistency, availability, partition tolerance at hand.  
The physics of the network, a fundamental wall,  
You can pick just two of the three...  
Cannot have it all!

(Outro - Both, fading out)  
So choose your two features, the trade-off is clear,  
In your system's design, there's always a fear.  
A law of the network, a truth we must learn.  
Cannot have it all!  
Cannot have it all!
```

### Prompt
```
Acoustic ballad with a hint of rap influence. Duet for a female and a male singer. The male singer can deliver the rap verses with a deep, husky male vocal, warm reverb, and gentle vibrato, while the female singer handles the chorus and harmonies with a deep, husky female vocal, warm reverb, and gentle vibrato. Instrumentally, use finger-picked guitar as the primary element. Layer harmonies properly, especially in the chorus. No drums. Include a light grand piano in the background and let a cello jam sometimes during the instrumental breaks, intro and the outro.  Raw, intimate, high fidelity, studio quality, acoustic nilon guitar, recorded in an empty room, warm reverb. Soulful guitar, story telling expressive guitar technique, delightful melancholy, 92 bpm. Out of three instruments, only one can change at a time.
