# Shadows Between Tongues

```
[Verse]
Half a word in my mouth
Half a word in the air
Lost the bridge
Found the silence
Do they even care
The streets don't echo my name
This place ain't mine
This place ain't the same

[Chorus]
Culture shock
A fistful of static
Dreams collide
It's automatic
Shadows between tongues
I can't see the sun
Chasing something
But I’m always undone

[Verse 2]
Held a camera like it could hold my soul
Snapped the light but it left a hole
Tried to dance
Tripped on my feet
This rhythm ain't mine
This life ain't sweet

[Prechorus]
Code on the screen
Pictures in my head
Dreams don’t sleep
They haunt me instead

[Chorus]
Culture shock
A fistful of static
Dreams collide
It's automatic
Shadows between tongues
I can't see the sun
Chasing something
But I’m always undone

[Bridge]
Failed start-ups
Broken frames
Lost in the dark
I don’t know my name
Every step forward feels like a fall
A language of walls
No words at all
```
