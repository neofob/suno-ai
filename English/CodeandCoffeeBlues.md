# Code and Coffee Blues

```
[Verse 1]
Debugging in the moonlight, my eyes about to crack
Coffee stains on my fingers, code is fighting back
Foosball in the breakroom, laughing through the grind
Dreams of changing the world, slipping out of mind

[Prechorus]
Bicycle wheels spinning, chasing morning sun
Hoping that the lines I write could be the chosen one

[Chorus]
But now I’m here, deploying dreams I never drew
Scrapping metrics, chasing numbers, feeling through and through
I’m not the spark, I’m not the code, I’m just a passing view
Oh, code and coffee blues

[Interlude: Melancholic harmonica Solo]

[Verse 2]
Fault-tolerant ambition, high performance highs
Burnout in the trenches, no time to ask why
Start-up life, it crushed me, dreams left on the floor
Now I’m pushing pipelines, just a cog and nothing more

[Prechorus]
Bicycle wheels rusting, parked outside the gate
Every line of YAML screams, "This ain’t your fate"

[Chorus]
But now I’m here, deploying dreams I never drew
Scrapping metrics, chasing numbers, feeling through and through
I’m not the spark, I’m not the code, I’m just a passing view
Oh, code and coffee blues

[solo]
