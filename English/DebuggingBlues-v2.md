# Debugging Blues

```
[Verse 1]
Beneath the glow of the monitor's stare,
Coffee stains and code that won't repair,
Bicycle tires spinning through the rain,
Late nights patching, debugging the pain.

[Prechorus]
Foosball tables, laughter in the air,
Dreams of scaling systems, nothing could compare.

[Chorus]
Now I'm scrapping metrics, no actions to take,
Pipelines deployed, but my heart feels fake.
The dream I chased, now a ghost in view,
Debugging blues, oh, I wanted more than you.

[Interlude: Melancholic harmonica Solo]

[Verse 2]
Fault-tolerance fantasies, they kept me alive,
HPC code—where ambition would thrive.
Burned out candles, fingers on the keys,
Dreams collapsed like a bug-ridden breeze.

[Prechorus]
Start-up life, it cuts and it grinds,
Now DevOps scripts are the ties that bind.

[Chorus]
Now I'm scrapping metrics, no actions to take,
Pipelines deployed, but my heart feels fake.
The dream I chased, now a ghost in view,
Debugging blues, oh, I wanted more than you.

[Solo guitar crying]
