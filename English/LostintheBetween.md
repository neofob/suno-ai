# Lost in the In-Between
```
[Verse]
Born in the cracks of two tongues
Half a map
No compass spun
Words tangle
Slip through my teeth
Who am I supposed to be

[Prechorus]
Mirror shows a stranger's eyes
Dreams buried under borrowed skies

[Chorus]
Lost in the in-between
Not enough
Never clean
Chasing shadows
Chasing scenes
Lost in the in-between

[Verse 2]
Shot a frame
It came out blurred
Ballet steps that never stirred
Built a tower
It fell apart
Code was wrong
I missed the start

[Prechorus]
Hands tremble
Reaching through the haze
Roads vanish
Leaving empty days

[Chorus]
Lost in the in-between
Not enough
Never clean
Chasing shadows
Chasing scenes
Lost in the in-between
