# Burnt Out DevOps Blues


### Lyric
```
[Verse]
Late nights, chasing bugs in the glow
Coffee stains on a desk, dreams running slow
Bicycle wheels spinning, through the city haze
Foosball laughs, teammates lost in those days

[Prechorus]
Now it's pipelines and logs, deploy and forget
Metrics stacking high, no action to get

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna scrape these charts no more
Dreams crushed, options worthless, thrown to the floor
I’m just a DevOps man, in someone else's shoes
Burnt out, riding these DevOps blues

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Checkpoint dreams, they flickered, now they're gone
Fault-tolerance software, where I thought I belonged
HPC nights, MPI in my veins
Now it’s YAML and scripts, drowning in mundane

[Prechorus]
Automated builds, but I’m stuck on repeat
Heart's disconnected, a code incomplete

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna scrape these charts no more
Dreams crushed, options worthless, thrown to the floor
I’m just a DevOps man, in someone else's shoes
Burnt out, riding these DevOps blues

[Solo]
```
