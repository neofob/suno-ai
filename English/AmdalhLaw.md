Amdahl's Law

### Lyric
```
[Intro guitar]

[Verse 1 - Male Vocal]
We're building a system, making it faster, the code is our key,
Parallel processing, for the whole world to see.
We add more cores, the power is immense,
But the speedup's not linear, it makes no sense!

[Verse 2 - Female Vocal]
There's a sequential part, the part that can't run,
On a dozen more processors when all is said and done.
The overhead of communication, the setup, the wait,
It all adds a burden, sealed by its fate.

[Chorus - Duet]
Oh Amdahl, Amdahl's Law, you show us the truth,
The limit to our speed, since our technological youth.
You can't speed up the parts that don't run side-by-side,
Oh diminishing returns, there's nowhere left to hide!

[Verse 3 - Male Vocal, enthusiastic]
We put a hundred machines on the problem right now,
The parallel portion should just fly, wow!
But that 10% that's serial, it holds us all back,
The overall efficiency is on the wrong track.

[Verse 4 - Female Vocal, thoughtful]
Even with infinite processors, the speedup is bound,
By that sequential fraction, on solid ground.
It's a stark reminder, in the world of computer design,
The limits of our scaling, a very clear sign.

[Chorus - Duet]
Oh Amdahl, Amdahl's Law, you show us the truth,
The limit to our speed, since our technological youth.
You can't speed up the parts that don't run side-by-side,
Oh diminishing returns, there's nowhere left to hide!

[Outro - Both, resolute]
So optimize the serial, make the parallel wide,
But Amdahl's Law is a constant, a force inside.
More cores won't always save us, the truth we discern.
Oh diminishing returns.
Oh diminishing returns.

### Prompts
```
Acoustic ballad with a rap influence. Duet for a female and a male singer. The male singer can deliver the rap verses with a deep, husky male vocal, warm reverb, and gentle vibrato, while the female singer handles the chorus and harmonies with a deep, husky female vocal, warm reverb, and gentle vibrato. Instrumentally, use finger-picked guitar as the primary element. Layer harmonies properly, especially in the chorus. No drums. Include a light grand piano in the background and let a cello jam sometimes during the instrumental breaks and the outro.  Raw, intimate, high fidelity, studio quality, acoustic nilon guitar, recorded in an empty room. Soulful guitar, story telling expressive guitar solo, delightful melancholy, random guitar riffs, 92 bpm.
