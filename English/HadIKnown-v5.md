# Had I Known
*Inspired from the movie Arrival, Fermat's principle..*

### Lyric
```
[Intro]
[Solo]

[Verb 1]
had I known the future,
would I cherish the present
without reminiscing the past?

[Prechorus]
had I known the end
with the fastest light path,
would I look for the other way?

[Chorus]
with all viable choices
pondering of different ends,
which path would I take?

[Bridge]
in all inevitable possibilities,
had I ever been
part of the equation?

[Interlude: Melancholic harmonica Solo]

[Verb 2]
had I known the future,
would I cherish the present
without reminiscing the past?

[Prechorus]
had I known the end
with the fastest light path,
would I look for the other way?

[Chorus]
with all viable choices
pondering of different ends,
which path would I take?

[Bridge]
in all inevitable possibilities,
had I ever been
part of the equation?

[Solo]
[Outro]
