# Fault-tolerance Blues

```
[Verse]
Coffee stains on the debug log,
Bicycle wheels through the morning fog,
Small town streets, a code-runner's song,
Chasing uptime, where'd I go wrong?

[Prechorus]
Foosball spins, the laughter fades,
Dreams of scale, now a slow cascade.

[Chorus]
I was building fault-tolerant dreams,
Checkpoint restart, held together with seams.
Now I’m scraping metrics, counting clues,
Living these fault-tolerant blues.

[Verse 2]
Burned-out nights, the screen’s cold glow,
Lines of code, but no heart to show.
DevOps grind, deploying what’s stale,
Scaling nothing, just chasing my tail.

[Prechorus]
Once a builder, now just maintain,
Patching software, drowning in pain.

[Chorus]
I was building fault-tolerant dreams,
Checkpoint restart, held together with seams.
Now I’m scraping metrics, counting clues,
Living these fault-tolerant blues.
