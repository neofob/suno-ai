# Halfway Home

```
[Introduction in piano]
[Verse]
Two tongues fighting in my mouth
One for the old land one for the now
Words fall flat hit the ground
No one hears no one cares no sound

[Prechorus]
Maps in my head don't lead anywhere
Dreams scatter like dust in the air

[Chorus]
Halfway home but never there
Feet on soil but hearts don’t share
I chase the frame I chase the code
Every door a locked-up road

[Verse 2]
Ballet shoes and camera clicks
Dreams like shadows playing tricks
Start-up broke and so did I
Every leap just hit the sky

[Prechorus]
Windows close while I'm still looking in
Every start feels like the end again

[Chorus]
Halfway home but never there
Feet on soil but hearts don’t share
I chase the frame I chase the code
Every door a locked-up road

[Solo piano]
[Outro in piano]
