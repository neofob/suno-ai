### Lyric
```
[Verse 1]
From point A to point B, the light must flee,
Across a boundary, for the world to see.
Two different mediums, with speed that's not the same,
How does it choose the path, in nature's complex game?

[Chorus]
Oh, the principle of Fermat, a law so neat and grand,
The path it always takes is the quickest in the land.
Not shortest distance, but shortest time, you see,
A journey of efficiency for light to be.

[Interlude: Melancholic piano solo]

[Verse 2]
It bends at the interface, a dance of angles bold,
Snell's Law is the result, a story often told.
The minimum of time is the journey's only goal,
A beautiful optimization, in control of the whole.

[Chorus]
Oh, the principle of Fermat, a law so neat and grand,
The path it always takes is the quickest in the land.
Not shortest distance, but shortest time, you see,
A journey of efficiency for light to be.

[Outro]
So when light travels on its way,
The time it takes defines the day.
From A to B, the quickest route is chosen well,
In every ray of light, its story it will tell...

```
Acoustic ballad with a rap influence. Duet for a female and a male singer. The male singer can deliver the rap verses with a deep, husky male vocal, warm reverb, and gentle vibrato, while the female singer handles the chorus and harmonies with a deep, husky female vocal, warm reverb, and gentle vibrato. Instrumentally, use finger-picked guitar as the primary element. Layer harmonies properly, especially in the chorus. No drums. Include a light grand piano in the background and let a cello jam sometimes during the instrumental breaks and the outro.  Raw, intimate, high fidelity, studio quality, acoustic nilon guitar, recorded in an empty room.
